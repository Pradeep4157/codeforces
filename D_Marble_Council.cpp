        OBSERVATIONS:

    i dont think the mod has any usage.. 


    so a multiset is given .. ( a )

    s needs to be created.. 

    we divide a into some multisets.. 

    and then for each multiset choose 

    one of its modes and add it to s . 

    total number of diff s possible.. 

    so order doesnt matter 

    looks like contri tech.. 

    here we choose some subsequence of elements..


    multiset with n elements there is only 

    1 way that is all elements in single ms ...

    for every len length multiset ...

    i have extra n - len elements which 

    i will use to make diff variations..
