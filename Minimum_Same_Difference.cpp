    f(a) 

    if all dist ele then f(a) == 0 .. 

    else.. 

        f(a) dist between two same ele.. (not same index..)

    n,k is given.. 

    among all arrays of size n.. 

    1<=ai<=k.. 

    sum of all these f(a)..

    maybe contri.. 

    maybe its counting how many times 1 will be there , 2 will be 

    there... k - 1 will be there.. 

    ok so for i = 1 && j == 2 && arr[i] == 1.. 

    k = 3...n values should be 2..k , there can be 1 but i dont want to consider that.

    i can write them i but it will cause overlap becuase it will increase 

    the current posssiblities along with when i consider arr[i] == 1 && i == 2 && j == 3

    that and this will overlap..
