        OBSERVATIONS:
    

    ok so there is a tree , .. root at r .. 

    he wants to find cuteness of the tree .. 

    so cuteness is .. 

    lets say tree is rooted at a node sr then for all dist 

    k nodes we select from the tree find all their lca, 

    and keep in a set .. 

    cuteness = no of dist nodes in the set .. 

    now he doesnt want to find cuteness , instead kawainess .. 

    which is sum of cuteness when each nodes is rooted .. 


    looks like a contribution technique question ...
