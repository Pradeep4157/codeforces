        OBSERVATIONS:

    so we need to  make as many indices in arr == b

    we can remove one element from arr && equivalent

    indexed element from b..

    i can transfrom ai == any ai with same parity ..

    && any bi with different parity ahead of that index..

    and there are consequences to doing this op..

    all the values till the value that i have taken

    can never be changed..

    also the use of one removal can be to change

    this pattern and unlock new values..

    that were not in the parity..
